# Theory
# 1. Application Structure:

The application could be separated into separate modules or layers, such as:

- Controller layer: Handles incoming API requests and invokes the necessary services.
- Service layer: Implements the business logic and interacts with external APIs (e.g., Poke API).
- Data layer: Manages the data storage or caching, if required.

# 2. Testing:

- Unit tests: Write unit tests to verify the behavior of individual functions or components, such as the getEvolutionChain and buildEvolutionChain functions. You can use testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha for this.
- Integration tests: Develop integration tests to verify the interaction between different layers of the application, such as making API requests and checking the responses.
- Mocking: Use mocking libraries or techniques to simulate external API responses during testing, ensuring that the tests are reliable and independent of external services.

# 3. Deployment and Releases:

- Containerization: Containerize the application using technologies like Docker. This allows for easy deployment and scalability across different environments.
- Orchestration: Use container orchestration tools like Kubernetes to manage the deployment and scaling of containerized application instances.
- CI/CD Pipeline: Set up a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline to automate the build, testing, and deployment processes. Tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or AWS CodePipeline can be used for this purpose.

# 4. API Versioning and Management:

- Versioning: Include the version number in the API endpoint URLs (e.g., /v1/pokemon/:name/evolution-chain). This allows the introduction of breaking changes in new versions while maintaining support for older versions.
- Documentation: Maintain comprehensive API documentation to guide frontend developers on how to use the endpoints and handle different versions.
- Deprecation Policy: Establish a deprecation policy to inform users about upcoming changes or retirements of specific API versions, giving them time to update their integrations.

# 5. Non-Functional Requirements:

- Caching: Implement caching mechanisms to improve response times and reduce load on external APIs, if applicable.
- Rate Limiting: Apply rate limiting techniques to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of the API resources.
- Error Handling: Design proper error handling and error response mechanisms to provide meaningful feedback to users and frontend applications.
- Logging and Monitoring: Set up logging and monitoring solutions to track the application's health, performance, and potential issues. Tools like Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Prometheus can be used for this purpose.
